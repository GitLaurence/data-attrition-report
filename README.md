## Excel Input Format

Your file must have a **header row as the first row**. Column names are matched case-insensitively.

### Accepted Column Names

| Field | Accepted column headers | Required |
|---|---|---|
| Employee Name | `Last Name` + `First Name` + `Middle Name` — or — `Name`, `Employee Name`, `Full Name` | Yes |
| Department | `Department`, `Dept`, `Division`, `Team` | Yes |
| Exit Date | `Date of Last Day`, `Exit Date`, `Termination Date`, `Separation Date`, `Last Day`, `Turned Over Date` | Yes (leave blank for active employees) |
| Reason | `Last Update`, `Reason`, `Exit Reason`, `Separation Reason`, `Type`, `Reason for Leaving` | Yes (leave blank for active employees) |
| Date Hired | `Date Hired`, `Date of Hire`, `Hire Date` | Required for Monthly Headcount Analysis |
| Remarks | `Remarks`, `Notes`, `Comment` | No |

Any other columns in the file are ignored.

### Including Active Employees

To unlock the full **Monthly Headcount Analysis** (Beginning Count, Ending Count, Attrition Rate), your file should include **all employees** — both current and departed — each with a `Date Hired` value:

- **Departed employees** — fill in `Date Hired`, `Exit Date`, and `Reason`
- **Active employees** — fill in `Date Hired` only; leave `Exit Date` and `Reason` blank

If the file contains only departed employees, the Beginning/Ending Count and Attrition Rate columns will show `—`.

### Accepted Reason Values

The `Reason` (or `Last Update`) column is normalized automatically. Accepted values and their aliases:

| Category | Accepted values |
|---|---|
| **Resignation** | `Resignation`, `Resigned`, `Resign`, `Voluntary`, `Voluntary Resignation`, or any value starting with `Resign` |
| **Termination** | `Termination`, `Terminated`, `Involuntary`, `Dismissed`, `Fired`, `AWOL`, `Absent Without Leave` |
| **Retirement** | `Retirement`, `Retired`, or any value starting with `Retir` |
| **Redundancy** | `Redundancy`, `Redundant`, `Laid Off`, `Layoff`, `Retrenchment` |
| **End of Contract** | `End of Contract`, `EOC`, `Contract Ended`, `Contract Expired`, `Fixed Term`, `End of Employment` |
| **Other** | Anything not matched above |

### Sample Data (split-name format, all employees)

```
Last Name  | First Name | Middle Name | Department  | Date Hired | Date of Last Day | Last Update  | Remarks

### Sample Data (single-name format)

```
Name             | Department  | Date of Last Day | Last Update

## Stat Cards

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Total Exits** | Count of all employee separation records found in the uploaded file. |
| **Peak Month** | The calendar month with the highest number of exits, with its count and share of all exits. |
| **Avg Attrition Rate** | Average of each month's attrition rate (departures ÷ beginning headcount), as a %, when Date Hired data is available. Otherwise, the average number of exits per year across all years in the data. |

Hover the **ⓘ** icon on any card to see a tooltip explanation directly in the app.

## Monthly Headcount Analysis

The section beneath the charts displays a card-based view designed for HR managers, with all values derived directly from the uploaded file.

### Period KPI Bar

A summary row at the top of the section shows totals for the currently filtered period:

| KPI | Description |
|---|---|
| **Period Start** | Headcount at the beginning of the first visible month |
| **Total Hired** | Sum of all new hires across visible months |
| **Total Exits** | Sum of all departures across visible months |
| **Period End** | Headcount at the end of the last visible month |
| **Avg Attrition** | `Total Exits ÷ Period Start × 100`, colour-coded green / yellow / red |

### Month Cards

Each card shows:

| Element | How it is calculated |
|---|---|
| **Attrition rate badge** | `Departures ÷ Beginning Count × 100` — green < 2%, yellow 2–5%, red ≥ 5% |
| **End of Month** | Employees hired on or before the last day with no exit date, or exit date after month end |
| **Net change** (▲ / ▼) | `Hired − Departed` for that month |
| **Hired** | Employees whose `Date Hired` falls within the month |
| **Departed** | Employees whose `Exit Date` falls within the month |

### Period Summary Card

A full-width card at the bottom aggregates the visible months and includes a **headcount trend sparkline** showing whether the workforce grew or shrank over the selected period.

### Filters

Use the **Year** and **Month** filter pills to narrow the view. The period KPI bar and summary card update automatically.
